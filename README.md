# Data-Pre-processing-Assignment
I am pleased to confirm the successful completion of the Data Pre-processing Assignment as part of the module "Introduction to Programming for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science." This assignment provided an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in various data pre-processing tasks essential for Data Science projects.

Task Overview:

Data Processing (70%):

Implemented Python code to read CSV data and convert it into nested structures.
Handled errors in the "dependants" column and printed a list of problematic rows.
Wrote records to JSON files based on specific criteria, including retired and employed customers.
Calculated additional metrics for ranking customers and stored results in a JSON file.
Data Visualization (20%):

Utilized Pandas and Seaborn libraries to perform univariate and multivariate plots.
Obtained statistical measures for salary and age data series.
Saved generated plots for future reference.
Code Presentation (10%):

Ensured clear and structured code with appropriate comments and variable naming.
Handled errors effectively and minimized code duplication.
Utilized Markdown cells within the Jupyter Notebook for clear explanations and instructions.
Deliverables:

Submitted a complete Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing all code implementations and output cells.
Included all required output files generated by the program (processed.json, retired.json, employed.json, remove_ccard.json, commute.json).
Ensured compliance with submission requirements and deadlines specified on Canvas.
Achievements:

Demonstrated proficiency in data pre-processing techniques, including file conversion, entry, filtering, and visualization.
Developed a robust and efficient Python codebase capable of handling diverse data structures and scenarios.
Produced clear and well-structured documentation within the Jupyter Notebook, facilitating ease of understanding and future reference.
I am confident that the successful completion of this assignment showcases my ability to tackle complex data pre-processing tasks effectively, setting a strong foundation for further studies and practical applications in the field of Data Science.
